## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-using-lstm.git
cd sentiment-analysis-using-lstm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!--
## Usage
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
To evaluate the model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
``` -->

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset). It contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model is built using the following layers:

- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Layer
- Dense Layer

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 96% on the test set on 10 epochs.
